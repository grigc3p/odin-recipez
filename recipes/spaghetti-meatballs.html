        Combine ground beef, bread crumbs, parsley, Parmesan, black pepper, garlic powder, and egg in a bowl. Form into meatballs.
         Store, covered, in the refrigerator until ready to use.
         While we love this method, some reviewers like to brown the meatballs before adding them to the sauce to lock in the flavor.

         <h2>Make the sauce</h2>
         In a large saucepan, combine garlic, onion, tomatoes, salt, sugar, and a bay leaf.
          Simmer those ingredients for 90 minutes.

          <h3>Add the meatballs</h3>
          Add tomato paste, basil, pepper, and the meatballs to the sauce.
           Simmer for an additional 30 minutes (or until meatballs are cooked).
